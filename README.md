# Skillcraft Internship Assignments

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **Skillcraft Internship**.  
Each assignment helped me build skills in **data exploration, visualization, and machine learning** using Python.

## Assignment 1 (World Population Analysis)  

**Objective:**  
Analyze the **world population dataset** to understand population growth trends, top countries, and continent-wise distribution.  

**Key Work Done:**  
- Explored dataset with Pandas (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.shape()`, `.describe()`)  
- Checked missing values and dataset structure  
- Analyzed population trends (1970–2022)  
- Visualized:  
  - Population growth over years  
  - Top 10 most populous countries in 2022  
  - Population distribution by continent (2022)  
- Tools: **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**

- Notebook: [`Assignment1.ipynb`](Assignment1.ipynb)
- Dataset:[`world_population.csv`](world_population.csv)

## Assignment 2 (Titanic Dataset Analysis)

**Objective:**  
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset.  

**Key Work Done:**  
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`Cabin`)  
- Filled missing values in `Age` with mean  
- Checked duplicates and cleaned dataset  
- Analyzed:  
  - Gender distribution  
  - Survival distribution (`Survived`)  
- Visualized results using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Tools: **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**

- Notebook: [`Assignment2.ipynb`](Assignment2.ipynb)
- Dataset:[`Titanic-Dataset.csv`](Titanic-Dataset.csv)

## Assignment 3 (Bank Marketing Dataset)  

**Objective:**  
Predict customer subscription to term deposits using the Bank Marketing dataset.  

**Key Work Done:**  
- Explored dataset (info, shape, missing values)  
- Renamed columns for clarity  
- Visualized:  
  - Target variable distribution (subscription)  
  - Subscription by job type  
  - Age distribution by subscription  
  - Correlation heatmap of numerical features  
- Applied **Label Encoding** for categorical variables  
- Attempted a **Decision Tree Classifier** (used confusion matrix & classification report)  
- Couldn’t fully conclude the model, but gained workflow understanding  
- Tools: **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn**

- Notebook: [`Assignment3.ipynb`](Assignment3.ipynb)
- Dataset:[`bank-additional-full.xls`](bank-additional-full.xls)

## Assignment 4 (Traffic Collisions Dataset) 

**Objective:**  
Analyze traffic collision data and attempt predictive modeling using K-Nearest Neighbors.  

**Key Work Done:**  
- Loaded and explored the dataset (datatypes, columns, missing values, shape, summary stats)  
- Renamed coordinates (`X → LONGITUDE`, `Y → LATITUDE`)  
- Built an **interactive Folium map** with clustering (first 5000 accident points)  
- Performed **EDA** using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib  
- Attempted a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model** for prediction  
- Couldn’t fully conclude the model, but gained exposure to ML workflows  
- Tools: **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Scikit-learn**

- Notebook: [`Assignment4.ipynb`](Assignment4.ipynb)
- Dataset:[`Collisions.csv.zip`](Collisions.csv.zip)
---

## Skills Learned & Improved  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium)  
- Introduction to Machine Learning Models (Decision Trees, KNN)  
- Workflow of predictive modeling

## How to Run the Notebooks  
1. Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` files.  
2. Open in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.  
3. Run all cells sequentially.  
4. Ensure datasets (`world_population.csv`, `Titanic-Dataset.csv`, `bank-additional-full.csv`, `Collisions.csv`) are in the same directory as notebooks.
